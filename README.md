G# Hello_World
first repository

My name is G Madhusudhan.
I'm from India.
Getting started with Github from 18 April 2018.
I am learning this for the purpose of saving R based projects that am going to work.

I am welcome to suggestions/ for any of the code, in terms of code aesthetics, performance and quality.

Thanks
